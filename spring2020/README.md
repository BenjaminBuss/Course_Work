 # Course work from my three stats courses for the Spring 2020 semester
 
 ## STAT 4000 Regression and Time Series Analysis
 Favorite class of the semester. Lots of time spent banging my head against problems.
 
 ## STAT 4100 Design of Experiment
 The majority of this class focused on the theory over any level of computation and that is reflected in my scripts for this class.
 
 ##STAT 2060 Statistical Computing
Most of this class(for me) was reviewing concepts I had previously be exposed to, all code is rather plain with nothing exciting.
