# Course Work

A repo where I just shove all the R I do in class, contains everything from side experiments, to assignments and quizes for my stats classes(even the ones I did bad on). 

## fall2019andearlier

Contains scripts from:
- STAT 2050: The basic stats class, most of the work was done in excel and Minitab but I attempted to do some of the assignments in R
- CS 1400: My main exposure to python, the class was more focused on the fundamentals of programming and the process. The only file is my final project. A rather rudimentary script which analyzed job data
- STAT 4200(Survey Sampling): A very enjoyable class that resulted in much less code than most my other 4XXX level classes. Most of these scripts contain attempts to explore or try various things.

## spring2020

Contains scripts from:
- STAT 2060(Statistical Computing): A one credit class that goes over the basics of R and SAS focusing on Stats work, over more general R programming skills
- STAT 4000(Regression and Time Series Analysis): An odd class which attempts to mesh theory and application, having us sometimes hand write premade algorithms, sometimes use premade stuff(IE determining linear regression coefficients using matrix multiplication instead of 'lm' and 'predict'.
- STAT 4100(Design of Experiment): A theory heavy course with very little playing around with code. Most of this stuff is just writing formulas in R instead of by hand.

## Misc
TBD
